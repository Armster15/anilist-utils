# anilist-to-txtfile
This exports an AniList user's library into a simple `txt` file. This may be useful if you want to have a backup of your library, or if you want to portably share your library as one file.

Note that this will only work if the user has their library publicly accessible.

## Usage
*Requires Node.js and npm installed*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Armster15/anilist-utils
cd anilist-utils/anilist-to-txtfile
npm install
npm run start
```
