# anilist-utils
This repository contains tools I developed for AniList. These tools were mostly developed to overcome certain problems or technicalities with AniList.


## Tools
- [**`anilist-cli-import`**](/anilist-cli-import/): Provides a CLI interface for importing your library into AniList

- [**`anilist-to-txtfile`**](/anilist-to-txtfile/): Exports an Anilist user's library as a simple TXT file

- [**`anilist-stars-to-smileys`**](https://gist.github.com/Armster15/b82176835de0965485a72d64c0c09bac/4ccddcd4ea56167e4cb5134da352c451b2e93905): A userscript that allows a user to have a 4 star system powered by smileys!
  - Note that this requires a userscript extension (Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey) and also requires the user to have the 5 star system as their scoring scale.
